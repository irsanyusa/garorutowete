They are said to cause unexplainable events that harm the recipient or the caller.</p><h3>1. 999 9999</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the numbers not to call in Thailand. Legend has it that if you wish to die after midnight, dial 999 9999. The story goes that once you make a wish, you want to meet your maker, a bizarre incident happens, and you are no more.</p><p class=align-left>There is controversy regarding this contact, as reports say it was set up to promote a movie. The eerie number is believed to be haunted 21 years after the film's debut.</p><h3>2. 801 820 0263</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the most popular American haunted numbers, and you should never pick it up. When you call this creepy digit, a man's voice counts 1-7. Someone calls out your name and tells you precisely what you are doing and your whereabouts. It's like a ghost standing next to you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8bb215425f5cc04d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ fun websites to go on when you're bored and don’t know what to do</span></p></a><h3>3. 0888 888 888</h3><p class=align-left>This contact originates from Bulgaria, and the country has placed this contact as one of the most cursed phone numbers in the world. The first owner died of cancer from radioactive poisoning, and the other two were shot down. These strange events forced Mobitel, the company issuing the digits, to block it permanently.</p><h3>4. 1-000-000 0000</h3><p class=align-left>This strange contact is linked to Asian people and is believed to be one of the haunted phone numbers. It is believed to be a call from the dead. It is said that if you see this call, your deceased relative is trying to reach you.</p><p class=align-left>People who received the call reported that a male voice instructed them to ask 15 people to call him back, failure to which they would die. Receiving this also causes mental torment just by talking to the dead, so do yourself a favour and avoid it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f46fb7c4d878d3fe.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>23 weird movies that will make your everyday life seem ordinary</span></p></a><h3>5. 701 347 1936</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8e127a6c8c3580b3.jpg><p class=align-left>This contact is one of the haunted phone numbers to call. Stories say you will die within a day if you dial these digits. A man is heard saying, "Votre toast, je peux vous le render," for approximately 32 seconds. These words are from a famous French song called Carmen by G. Bizet.</p><h3>6. The Red Number</h3><p class=align-left>The Red Number is from Pakistan, and it caused a stir in 2007 when people received alarming emails and <a href=#>text messages</a> about the contact. It was said that the contact had a high-frequency range that damaged brain nerves and even caused death.</p><p class=align-left>These emails and texts were traced to certain phone and ID numbers with these digits. People were warned not to receive or look at these red digits.

When you dial the digits, it is said that you hear a male voice uttering disturbing and blaring noises. The noises are like codes being decoded which people believe are death messages. This is a call you don't want to try, even though no death has been linked to this contact.</p><h3>8. 20202020</h3><p class=align-left>This UK contact is said to be creepy. It is in a book containing ghost stories from the 1970s in the UK. The story is about how kids dialed 20202020, and a woman on the other side yells, "Help Me! Help Me!! Suzie's dying". The voice could also be heard saying, "Help Me! Help Me!! Suzie's drowning". People have yet to verify these stories, but the thought of dialling these digits is creepy.</p><h3>9. 407 734 0254</h3><p class=align-left>This contact is associated with a clown who lives in Naples, Florida. It is one of the famous ghost numbers that people avoid calling. Legend has it that when you call 407 734 0254, it connects you to Wrinkles, the clown.
