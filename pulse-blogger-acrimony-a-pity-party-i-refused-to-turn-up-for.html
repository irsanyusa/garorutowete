From the narration by <strong>Taraji</strong> who played Melinda— a narration that was steeped in brokenness, helplessness and most importantly an unconscious appeal to the <strong>sympathy</strong> of the target audience.&nbsp; You cannot help seeing the movie and story from her standpoint.&nbsp; You may try to maintain a straight line of thinking while watching but I bet you won't know when you <strong>stagger</strong> off the line and plunge into a mucky water of her story.</p><p>Before you notice what had happened to you, you must have turned into a model of pity.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Tyler Perry and his crew studied the <strong>human emotions </strong>thoroughly not because they had an exam to pass but because you cannot manipulate what you don't understand.&nbsp; They had to understand the ‘why’s’, the ‘WTF's’, the ‘Awwwwws’, the ‘YES!’ the ‘this is cute’ and every other thing in relation to the <strong>anatomy</strong> of the human emotion.</p><p>The movie had everybody thinking about what they will do in that case, it had some people interpret their <a href=# id=eaaad994-e344-5c05-a31f-3daa691985c9>relationship</a> with that <strong>script</strong>; it had some other people on the sidelines of love say "You see why love is Bullshit?&nbsp; You see why I am <strong>incapable</strong> of love?&nbsp; Acrimony is why"</p><p>Bitterness, Hatred, Animosity, Enmity.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Acrimony is such a nice word that it barely even fits its <strong>description</strong> compared with the words above and other cruel sounding ones.</p><p>The reason the movie is raising eye brows is simply because Tyler tweaked the ending and instead of the conventional love story “Awwwwwns”,&nbsp; he said "let's give them some <strong>WTF</strong> moments". And Boom!</p><p>He did it and a conversation ensued: who is <strong>wrong</strong> and who is <strong>right</strong>?</p><p>It became an irritating exercise of side taking and a festival of generalizations. It became a reminder to women that <strong>men were scum</strong>.&nbsp; The movie made them forget that the art of "scumry" is like breathing.&nbsp; Everybody owns a scum side that always shows or rarely shows.</p><p><strong>Melinda.</strong>&nbsp; A young pretty girl mistakenly runs into a young man Robert on a rainy school day and her books scatter across the wet floor like bottle covers in a pub. Her first reaction is what ruined her—anger.&nbsp; Not normal anger—an abnormal <strong>violent</strong> anger that encouraged her to hit a sturdy black man who she didn't know anything about.&nbsp; She threw logic to the wind and managed to land few punches on him.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Robert</strong> picks up the papers and tracks her down with the INTENT of <strong>apologizing</strong>. He went to her room to apologize and just like many "one night stands" that <strong>ended</strong> in <a href=# id=96082cbb-ab37-5a6e-9854-19bfd94c58c5>marriage</a>; he fell in love with her.&nbsp; The way he looked at her changed. He saw a glow that was never there when she hit him. She saw a walking and talking <strong>sexiness</strong> stand before her door armed with a chocolate skin and a broad smile.</p><p>I wouldn't say who fell before whom. I want to believe they fell together. Like an on-your-marks kind of falling.</p><p>Now, on their first date, he didn't hesitate just like everyone else with a big dream to tell her his lofty dreams.&nbsp; I am sure that at the time <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> was building <strong>facebook</strong>, the conversations he had on date nights must have had boring tales of how was going to bring the whole world together with a single application.</p><p>Robert was that and <strong>more</strong>.</p><p>He shared HIS dreams probably expecting <strong>reciprocation</strong> but it never came.&nbsp; She didn't have something she was chasing, like a dream job or something.&nbsp; She had interest in just graduating from school.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>They were direct opposites.</p><p>Now, men or women who are given to inventions and great ideas stay either SINGLE or they are married to SOMEONE (Male or female) who <strong>completes</strong> them. Someone who they can run to and ask "hey, I'm trying to fix X but Y is popping up.&nbsp; What should I do? Should a make an x out of the y? "</p><p>Someone who <strong>supports</strong> the dream with something more tangible than money!</p><p>Moreover, take this to the bank: Money didn't do half of the things sharing of ideas and <strong>criticisms</strong> of ideas did when facebook was a baby idea. I say this with a wonderful amount of conviction because money doesn’t birth ideas.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>I honestly think people didn't watch this movie with an <strong>understanding</strong> of how society works.</p><p>She gave him an idea of a better name to call his battery.&nbsp; It was a naming ceremony that involved <strong>lovers</strong>, like lord Lugard and his wife who <strong>after sex</strong> named the largest country in Africa Nigeria</p><p>Good.&nbsp; Great!</p><p>But it wasn't the name that made it buyable or appealing. The name didn’t save that idea for the entire <strong>18 years</strong> that it suffered rejection and neglect.</p><p>Let's digress a bit to the incident that <strong>marred</strong> the relationship at first.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Robert being a <strong>prostitute</strong> decided not to nurture his common sense by at least being faithful to a girl that just got you a car.&nbsp; Now, I’m not even saying that you can <a href=# id=76358616-902c-5af5-b66b-16ede4f5e0c2>cheat </a>if you are not given a car.&nbsp; I am saying that it takes a higher level of <strong>disregard</strong> to cheat on someone you love who <strong>sacrificed</strong> thousands of dollars to get you a car.</p><p>Robert was a fool by letting the thought of cheating linger in his mind.</p><p>We humans have two sides: physical and emotional sides. Melinda’s <strong>emotional</strong> side was damaged already. Yet, Melinda wasn't reasonable enough to guard her physical side which was at least healthier than her emotional side.</p><p>She decided to be <strong>impaired</strong> emotionally and physically by deciding to run into his caravan attempting to kill him.</p><p>I won't <strong>defend</strong> her actions with "oh, she's got anger issues that she couldn't manage." I'm not doing that!&nbsp; If not, it'll be cool to say "Oh, ISIS terrorists have a terrible anger problem.&nbsp; If only they can be treated they'll stop bombing.” You see how stupid it sounds?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Now, small praise for Robert:</p><p>It is bad to <strong>hurt</strong> someone you love or better still someone who loves you.&nbsp; On the other hand, it is also bad to attempt to kill someone you love because he <strong>cheated</strong>.</p><p>Like, Robert would have lost his life midway into orgasm.&nbsp; She saw them having <strong>sex</strong> and then she decided to screw them too by attempting to <strong>kill them</strong>—a threesome gone wrong.</p><p>Robert and Diana ran out unscathed and she was already bleeding from her nose.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Scratch that.</p><p>Robert didn't even think of how he almost got killed when he was <strong>begging</strong> her for <a href=# id=40a3b8f8-9bf2-5e02-bc9e-38272d307296>forgiveness</a>. He didn't bother thinking of how she would have moved on to another guy had he died.&nbsp; He just wanted one thing: <strong>A second chance</strong> to prove he could be faithful.</p><p>Had Tyler Perry turned the table of that scene where she hit his caravan house and let's say he gets injured and finally becomes a cripple, you'll be <strong>shocked</strong> at how the tone of the arguments will change.&nbsp; We'll hear sermons of how karma is a wonderful soldier that defends the defenseless.&nbsp; We'll have women trying to be employees of karma by attempting murder tomorrow.&nbsp; And you'll be shocked at the percentage of people who wouldn't give a single damn about the dead fella.</p><p>When she was running into that caravan with her car, she didn't mean to hurt herself.&nbsp; She <strong>wanted</strong> him DEAD. She was pulling the bow so hard she didn't know the arrow was aimed at her forehead.</p><p>She wanted him back.&nbsp; She would have <strong>averted</strong> further misery by letting him go but she didn't.&nbsp; She wanted to love him with his <strong>brokenness</strong> and his obvious imperfections.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Anger, third party and assumptions are the <strong>tripod</strong> on which their wrecked marriage stood on.</p><p>I've discussed anger lengthily. Let's talk about third party and the role it played in Melinda's misery.</p><p>Melinda's <strong>sisters</strong> NEVER liked Robert. I remember her telling her sisters that they must like him.&nbsp; Of course they tried but it wasn't cake walk.</p><p>When a third party is involved in a relationship, they are mostly <strong>foolish</strong>. The eldest sister of Melinda ticks all the boxes of foolishness.&nbsp; She was <strong>selfish</strong>.&nbsp; She just wanted to be able to say "Yo, I told you years ago to live his battery-inventing-broke-ass alone but you was in love. &nbsp;Now see what has happened?”&nbsp; This was her aim all through the movie.&nbsp; To <strong>prove</strong> to her baby sister that she made a wrong choice.&nbsp; Such undiluted <strong>bitterness</strong> deep seated in her heart.</p><p>She saw a purse that belonged to the girl that cost her sister her womb and all a grown woman thought about was running to her sister whose <strong>marriage</strong> has been standing on one leg because Robert didn't want any job.&nbsp; He wanted his battery to replace the sun.&nbsp; She ran to her sister with <strong>fulfillment</strong> in her eyes. Her dream had come true.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Robert DIDN'T cheat. They had just coffee and discussed his battery— a productive discussion that changed the cause of his life forever.</p><p>Melinda, a wreck rushes to the house to <strong>complete</strong> the beating she started years ago in school.&nbsp; They created a scene.&nbsp; He was already on his way going for the presentation of what will be the genesis of her <strong>dreams</strong> of luxury.&nbsp; She almost stopped him but he staggered into that company and had a deal of 800 thousand dollars turned down.</p><p>People argued on twitter that he was <strong>selfish</strong> by not taking that 800k. I didn't blame them for being so sincere with their Myopia. I blame social media that has replaced looking at the "big picture" with <strong>scampering</strong> for dope pictures that’ll illicit likes.</p><p>Robert <strong>invested</strong> 18 years of his life in this project.&nbsp; No family.&nbsp; Not one member of his family to tell him that all was going to be well. He was ALONE with his confusions and frustrations. You may say "He had a wife" and I'll tell you that you are estranged to reality.&nbsp; As a man or woman in love,&nbsp; no matter how you try to spin it, there are certain <strong>frustrations</strong> you go through that your spouse will know about but only your family will understand you a hundred percent. No disrespect to the marriage institution but it is what it is.</p><p>Robert didn't have anyone to run to—Just his wife who he wouldn't blame for giving up on him before he struck gold.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>He was not going to take that <strong>meager</strong> amount all because of a house.&nbsp; He will be doing himself a great disservice by doing that. There is a stubbornness that accompanies greatness and focus—a reckless <strong>disregard</strong> for desperation no matter how bad you want it. Robert had that stubborn trait which made him slam the door against 800k dollars. This was someone who didn't have 50 dollars on him at the time.</p><p>To some, that was stupidity. To few people who can relate to such stubbornness, cheers.</p><p>Getting home and announcing to his raging partner that he turned down such deal came off as <strong>insensitive</strong> to me. I think that there were other things to say apart from that. I mean, in a house that was choking with confusion and impending <a href=# id=340231f0-c365-53f2-96d9-d01c1ea93732>depression</a>, you waltz in telling them that you turned down 800k that could easily barter their confusions.</p><p>Make no mistake; "Roberts" of this life do not think the way others do. He might have turned down that deal because of its <strong>pointlessness</strong>.&nbsp; 800k wasn't going to fulfill his promises to his wife. It wasn't going to get the diamond ring or the boat or even one engine of a private jet.&nbsp; It doesn't even come close to what he had gone through for 18 years.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It is easy to label him "selfish" because of democracy of words but I feel that <strong>selfish</strong> is rather a harsh word. I feel focusing on the big picture was used interchangeably with selfishness a lot in the conversations I've seen on twitter.</p><p>Melinda <strong>defiantly</strong> puffing smoke to his face and wishing she could squeeze the life out of his neck.&nbsp; She walked him out of the house that she sacrificed for his project.&nbsp; He <strong>begged</strong> but he knew the woman he got married to. She even bragged about her madness once or twice in the movie.&nbsp; She even said “You know me. I can be the <strong>devil</strong>”</p><p>Robert left and wandered into homelessness.&nbsp; No job.&nbsp; No wife. No family.&nbsp; No love.</p><p>Melinda stayed. At least she had family—her sisters and their husbands who played roles in their <strong>divorce</strong>. Talking about the divorce; Robert walked into that room crestfallen, he was forced out of his will to sign those papers.&nbsp; He resisted by <strong>begging</strong> her before the lawyers and her family but Melinda was hell bent on that. The divorce meant a lot to her eldest sister whose dream finally came true.</p><p>He left the room he had walked into as a married man divorced.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Melinda got busy that night under the sheets moaning with eyes closed trying to see heaven. She went down with <strong>another man</strong> hours after divorcing.</p><p>Now, girls support this with an argument that it was her way of moving on from Robert.&nbsp; I honestly do not understand how people <strong>maltreat</strong> their brains by saying things like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleeping with hundred men with the sole aim of moving on from one man is never logical and rather looks like <strong>choking</strong> the universe with all the <a href=# id=a0c3dea5-957f-5e51-af20-8f4ac4d68bc3>promiscuity </a>that being in a relationship didn't afford you.</p><p>Diana <strong>replaced</strong> the woman who had made sure that Robert was frustrated resigned from Prescott and that felt like God working according to Robert.&nbsp; After she had met with Robert seconds after leaving her car, she got to the office and asked her secretary to get her all the files that had<strong> Robert Gayle</strong> on it.</p><p>She spent her time going through the videos from the first one he sent to the last one. She sat there <strong>watching</strong> the man she once had inside her frolic with his lover amidst hugs and mushiness.</p><p>People argued that she wanted Robert for herself and that was why she helped in the first place. I didn’t see an ulterior motive in her actions and inactions. When she helped him get an <strong>appointment</strong> with Mr Prescott, he was still married. As a matter of fact, he had rubbed it in; “Diana, I am married. I don’t cheat on MY wife”. Of everything he had wanted to do at the time, <strong>cheating</strong> wasn’t on the list because of the turn he life had taken.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Robert according to the judge was way too kind out of his own free will. He came to Melinda’s office with a <strong>bouquet</strong> of rose flowers just to tell her “Our battery hit”. He didn’t have to after all, I mean; she had forced him through a divorce and had <strong>thrown him out</strong> of their house. Yet, Robert deemed it necessary to come give her the news without contempt.</p><p>It was then that she knew that she had <strong>messed</strong> up. I can boldly argue that she left him because the battery dream seemed <strong>dead</strong> and she didn’t want to “Waste” more years with a loser. Now, let’s get something straight; I’m all for equality of the both sexes and I find this statement cringe worthy; “After wasting my time with you all these years…” You can hardly see a man that <strong>uses</strong> that statement.</p><p>It always comes from the females. When they say that, you can see the <strong>regret</strong> in their voice, you can see the unconscious plea for a refund of all those years as though the relationship didn’t involve two people. Melinda wanted a <strong>refund</strong> of all the money she had spent on Robert. Robert gave her a ten million dollar cheque with the keys to her mother’s house. The <strong>generosity</strong> level he showed was stratospheric even the judge said he hadn’t seen such in his court.</p><p>Honestly, I think demanding for all the money you spent on your lover after the love goes sour is as <strong>stupid</strong> as any other person asking for a refund of all the laughter’s, blushes, cuddles, butterflies and even orgasms.</p><p>Melinda realized she was a loser already and went <strong>ballistic</strong>. She created a pseudo account and stalked Diana as though Diana had her placenta. She <strong>threatened</strong>, she cussed, she promised to be a thorn in the flesh of Diana. Let us not forget how she believed that coming to Roberts house with lingerie will bring them back together after she had promised him at her office; “We are not getting back together Robert”.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Now, it is her that desires the <strong>comeback</strong> but sadly, he had moved on.&nbsp; Make no mistake; she still loved him and he still loved her. I mean; who gives his enemy a 10 million dollar check? But, just as we have seen countless times— we <strong>almost never</strong> get to marry our one true love. We know them, they know us but there is something somewhere that makes it completely impossible to happen.</p><p>Melinda blamed her sisters, she said that they got into her head and <strong>messed</strong> up their relationship. She wanted to <strong>seduce</strong> him with her strapped lingerie and Diana walked into them and kept her calm until Robert did an introduction that ran Melinda out of the house.</p><p>The reason I refused to turn up for the pity party Melinda threw with her narration was simple; she was playing the <strong>victim</strong>. The narration was her point of view. Had Robert handled that narration, we would have seen and <strong>understood</strong> the anatomy of pain, rejection and frustrations. He would have taken the viewers down the dusty road of neglect and disregard.</p><p>If Melinda claims that Robert wasted her time and <strong>destroyed</strong> her life, Robert can claim that she was a bad omen in his life because it was after the divorce from her that his dream came true. Post relationship claims are full of crazy <strong>sentiments</strong> and well tailored blackmail. I stay out of conversations that see to a verbal brawl of people who once loved themselves.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Everything Melinda lost in Acrimony was her fault. Everything!</p><p>She lost her <strong>womb</strong> because of her anger. There was no point in trying to bring down that caravan house. She lost her marriage because a grown woman like her let her disgruntled sisters to advice her to leave her husband while they lived with theirs.&nbsp; Losing her own life was her fault too. She didn’t pay heed to the<strong> judge’s instruction.</strong></p><p>She found her way into the boat she claimed was hers. In fact, Melinda was a mad woman. She was an <strong>insane</strong> woman! I won’t exhaust the little sympathy I have left on Melinda. She doesn’t deserve the effort of pity. I will not feel sorry for her because of her <strong>anger issue.</strong> It was her duty to fix her life and not my duty to share pity when things go south as a result of her not seeking help.</p><p>Melinda ruins a boat cruise with her bitterness. Shoots at Robert and axes his leg. She dies and he dies. At least she had succeeded in killing him after trying years ago.&nbsp; This was her only <strong>success</strong> in the movie—killing and Robert and ruining his new found love with her new found insanity.</p><p>Finally, I feel a certain level of <strong>gratification</strong> knowing that I have penned down half the way I feel about Acrimony and most importantly throw my weight behind the conversation. You may want to see my submission as <strong>insensitive</strong> or wicked but I promise not to budge because you won’t understand how I dislike being generous with sympathy. I use it <strong>sparingly</strong> like a foolish man uses wisdom.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Written by Mark Anthony Osuchukwu.</strong></p><p>Mark Anthony Osuchukwu is a writer, social commentator and critic.
