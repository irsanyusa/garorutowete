He moved from one school to another because of fights. He has begun rhyming from the age of 16 and has signed up with the respected New York rapper Mic Geronimo soon after. Their joint song was produced by Irv Gotti, who later became a partner of the artist in the music business and made a lot of efforts to make Ja Rule net worth so high.</p><h3>Ja Rule bio</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/927bdcacf8db8f60.jpg><p class=align-left>The Roman expression “I came, I saw, I won” ideally suited for the description of the rapid start of Ja's career. He was one hundred percent product of his era, being at the right time in the right place. Severe, but at the same time, the velvety timbre of his voice favourably distinguished the rapper from all the others.</p><p class=align-left>His performance contrasted particularly with the singing of R&B singers and artists, who in large numbers willingly cooperated with him. If Ja chose hardcore rap for himself, then a direct collision and confusion with the same DMX could not be avoided. However, since he played in another field, no one else could merely compete with him.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5f38986448ec52af.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the interesting details about Lil Nas X: age, net worth, is he gay?</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Josh Peck wife Paige O'Brien bio: age, dad, pregnancy, married life</p><p class=align-left>“Put It On Me” is one of the most famous songs of Ja Rule, as well as, along with “Between Me & You,” the starting point in becoming a rapper as the creator of hits for MTV, radio and all sorts of urban charts.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>Later, as a result, the misalliance of two polar, but talented artists Ja Rule and Ashanti appeared in one of the most striking and long-playing unions in hip-hop. In total, you can count about ten joint songs, including their participation in the tracks of third performers. The essential tracks of Ja and Ashanti were “Always On Time,” “Mesmerize” and, of course, “Wonderful” with R Kelly.</p><p></p><p class=align-left>In 2005, Ja Rule matured to release his first <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">collection of major hits</a>. However, besides the already familiar songs on the disc, one could find fresh songs that were not yet published anywhere else.
