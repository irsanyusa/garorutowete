A&nbsp;water temperature of&nbsp;50ºF is&nbsp;a&nbsp;nightmare. It&nbsp;feels much colder than the air of&nbsp;the same temperature.</p><p>The passengers of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Titanic data-link=tag>Titanic</a> were in&nbsp;28ºF water. Can you imagine how cold it&nbsp;was? Even the iceberg that the Titanic met was warmer. The water didn’t freeze because of&nbsp;the high salt content.</p><p>But what if&nbsp;the temperature had been higher? What if&nbsp;the Titanic had sunk in&nbsp;warm water, say 120ºF? Theoretically, this could have happened had the waters of&nbsp;the North Atlantic met a&nbsp;warm undercurrent from the southern part of&nbsp;the ocean on&nbsp;disaster day. But this heat wouldn’t have been enough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/5c6/4f3/1500d253b382761719e4df5e7e.jpeg><p>The ocean area is&nbsp;too vast, and the temperature is&nbsp;too low at&nbsp;night. The warm undercurrent alone wouldn’t have made a&nbsp;difference for people who were overboard. But if&nbsp;the Titanic had sunk in&nbsp;another place at&nbsp;one particular moment, perhaps then all people could have been saved thanks to&nbsp;an&nbsp;incredible natural phenomenon. Now onboard, everybody.</p><p>Our voyage to&nbsp;a&nbsp;parallel universe begins. It’s a&nbsp;moonless night on&nbsp;April 14-15. The Titanic crashes into an&nbsp;iceberg. Icy water floods the lower decks. The captain sends a&nbsp;distress signal. The nearest rescue ship Carpathia is&nbsp;58&nbsp;miles away from the sinking Titanic. At&nbsp;maximum speed, Carpathia will get there in&nbsp;4&nbsp;hours. That’s quite long, even in&nbsp;warm tropical waters, since your body loses heat anyway. The Titanic begins to&nbsp;sink. The crew downs lifeboats. Some of&nbsp;the passengers jump overboard.</p><p>The ship is&nbsp;going under the water. There are no&nbsp;boats left, so&nbsp;you jump along with other passengers. It&nbsp;feels as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you got inside a&nbsp;huge iceberg. The water is&nbsp;so&nbsp;cold that it’s hard for you to&nbsp;move. You can’t even scream because there’s no&nbsp;air in&nbsp;your lungs. But at&nbsp;this moment, you feel a&nbsp;pleasant warmth coming from the depths. The heat rises above your knees and waist, then reaches your neck. Finally, you regain control of&nbsp;your muscles and can breathe deeply.</p><p>You notice that all the other passengers feel the same warmth. The water becomes a&nbsp;little hot. It&nbsp;makes you happy. But in&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment, horror replaces your delight. The ocean begins to&nbsp;foam. And not because of&nbsp;the high temperature, but because something is&nbsp;rising from the ocean floor. You hear a&nbsp;heavy low sound coming from the depths. It’s not a&nbsp;sinking Titanic, but something bigger. You can see a&nbsp;huge iceberg nearby. It’s melting, and a&nbsp;huge chunk is&nbsp;breaking off from&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/3b9/a03/50652e5fed8be53a845e9a2b5e.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;million bubbles appear on&nbsp;the surface. Then you feel something hit you in&nbsp;the leg. Thousands of&nbsp;strange lightweight rocks are rising from below. There are also massive plates among them. People use them as&nbsp;lifeboats. You climb on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;those rocks and look at&nbsp;the ship. It&nbsp;doesn’t sink since all the water is&nbsp;bubbling and pushing the vessel&nbsp;up. You take one of&nbsp;the small rocks and understand everything. It’s pumice!</p><p>An&nbsp;underwater volcano has woken up&nbsp;right under the ship. Thousands of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;volcanic rock are floating to&nbsp;the surface. When it&nbsp;erupts, its magma shakes the entire space, heats the water, and destroys the seabed. But it&nbsp;doesn’t result in&nbsp;anything destructive on&nbsp;the surface. The enormous pressure of&nbsp;hundreds of&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;gallons of&nbsp;water suppresses the volcano’s power. Molten rocks of&nbsp;the Earth’s crust are pressed against the seabed, and pumice rises to&nbsp;the surface. And here’s why it&nbsp;happens.</p><p>The upper part of&nbsp;Earth consists of&nbsp;many solid parts&nbsp;— tectonic plates. These plates collide with each other and divide. And when one part separates from another, the magma immediately comes&nbsp;up. So, all volcanoes are these unstable fault sites. If&nbsp;the Titanic had sailed over one of&nbsp;these areas during an&nbsp;eruption, many passengers would have been saved.</p><p>Back in&nbsp;the parallel universe, you notice the Titanic starts sinking again. The water is&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer bubbling. The volcano has gone out. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;seconds, the ocean turns icy again. Fortunately, you have your pumice lifeboat. This is&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;wait for rescuers. But let’s imagine a&nbsp;situation with no&nbsp;underwater volcano and an&nbsp;iceberg. A&nbsp;situation when the water was warm from the very beginning...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/fc8/91e/fa40a0598481f3b0b792fe3234.jpeg><p>One of&nbsp;the engines in&nbsp;the motor compartment of&nbsp;the ship breaks down. Several pipes burst because of&nbsp;increased pressure, and now there’s a&nbsp;crack in&nbsp;the ship’s body. Water is&nbsp;filling the lower decks. The ship is&nbsp;sinking. People evacuate on&nbsp;lifeboats. There’s less panic since the night is&nbsp;warm, and no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;freezing. Each passenger gets a&nbsp;life jacket. The ship is&nbsp;breaking. You understand that you have to&nbsp;jump.</p><p>The Titanic goes underwater. Many passengers fall overboard in&nbsp;horror. They dive into the dark ocean and immediately come to&nbsp;the surface. Panic and complete chaos take over. The ship disappears in&nbsp;the dark, and finally, it’s all silent. A&nbsp;few minutes pass, and you notice there’s no&nbsp;panic at&nbsp;all. The water is&nbsp;warm. Almost all passengers have life jackets. Someone is&nbsp;floating on&nbsp;the wooden ship wreckage. After a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;hours, the water no&nbsp;longer seems so&nbsp;comfortable. The ocean takes away your body heat. To&nbsp;keep warm, passengers swim closer to&nbsp;each other in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tight circle.</p><p>Yeah, now it’s quite possible to&nbsp;wait for another couple of&nbsp;hours till the rescuers come. People on&nbsp;lifeboats sail closer and take those who freeze on&nbsp;board. Passengers take turns: 20&nbsp;minutes in&nbsp;the water, then 20&nbsp;minutes in&nbsp;boats. It’s essential not to&nbsp;take your clothes off: even a&nbsp;wet outfit helps keep your body warm for longer. And when it&nbsp;seems that everyone is&nbsp;saved, somebody screams. A&nbsp;girl in&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat looks scared. She trembles with fear and points her finger into the black water.</p><p>Passengers try to&nbsp;see what’s there and notice a&nbsp;triangular fin. One, two, three... There are so&nbsp;many of&nbsp;them! The noise of&nbsp;the sinking ship has attracted a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;sharks. And now, they are circling the survivors, hoping to&nbsp;satisfy their hunger. They’re swimming slowly. It&nbsp;doesn’t look like they’re going to&nbsp;attack. But you should keep your eyes open, as&nbsp;these fish are some of&nbsp;the world’s most aggressive and dangerous sharks&nbsp;— the bull sharks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/0ca/af3/bfb140583babade9b32a8b0bb2.jpeg><p>They can be&nbsp;agile, fast, and unpredictable. They don’t swim in&nbsp;the cold waters of&nbsp;the Atlantic, but the water in&nbsp;this parallel universe is&nbsp;perfect for them. The sharks are strong and sturdy. They create the illusion of&nbsp;slowness to&nbsp;relax their prey. They’re called bull sharks because of&nbsp;their short blunt muzzle, like that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bull, and they like to&nbsp;hit a&nbsp;target or&nbsp;other sharks with their forehead.</p><p>Several fish are ramming boats. Someone falls into the water. Fortunately, people help them back on&nbsp;board. The sharks aren’t going to&nbsp;retreat. Chaos and panic ensue. People are screaming and splashing the water with paddles to&nbsp;scare away the fish, but it&nbsp;doesn’t help. One of&nbsp;the sharks opens its toothy mouth and clings to&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat.</p><p>At&nbsp;this moment, you notice more fins nearby. A&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;great white sharks arrives at&nbsp;the party. They are some of&nbsp;the most dangerous animals on&nbsp;the planet. They are big, fast, and strong, and their 300 triangular teeth lined in&nbsp;several rows are sharp as&nbsp;blades. Great white sharks swim around the boats and scare away the bull sharks. You fall off the boat and see a&nbsp;big fin approaching you. Fear awakens the survival instinct in&nbsp;you.</p><p>You’re trying your best to&nbsp;swim away from the shark as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible. Of&nbsp;course, it’s useless since the shark is&nbsp;much faster and will definitely catch you. You feel your foot touching the shark’s nose. The other foot gets into the toothy mouth. You scream in&nbsp;horror. After a&nbsp;second, the shark lets you&nbsp;go. Great white sharks rarely attack people. If&nbsp;they bite, it’s just to&nbsp;test you. After all, the shark’s favorite prey is&nbsp;seals. It&nbsp;simply loses interest if&nbsp;it&nbsp;realizes you aren’t a&nbsp;seal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/b35/936/d741bb5f71881d30386e2b949b.jpeg><p>But if&nbsp;the shark is&nbsp;starving, it&nbsp;doesn’t matter to&nbsp;it&nbsp;what kind of&nbsp;prey you are. Lucky for you, this one is&nbsp;not like that. Those survivors in&nbsp;the boats have almost nothing to&nbsp;fear, either. Great white sharks don’t attack them. They can push boats slightly, but only to&nbsp;test them. The great white shark is&nbsp;swimming away from you.</p><p>But a&nbsp;bull one appears. And it&nbsp;looks like it’s hungry. The shark is&nbsp;swimming towards you, opens its mouth, and... a&nbsp;loud ship horn penetrates the water. This is&nbsp;RMS Carpathia that has come to&nbsp;the rescue.</p><p>All the sharks swim away scared. All passengers are saved. Back in&nbsp;our universe, another ship that had been nearby could have saved the passengers much earlier. But that’s another story.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lpJ7BorrInGSsmZ6geqq6jGpoaWWUmrSzscSsZLCZoqJ6uK3TnqlmcGFrfXGEjg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./16-people-shared-awkward-moments-that-still-make-them-cringe-806605.html>&#171;&nbsp;17 People Shared Awkward Moments That Still Make Them Cringe</a>
