My personal tip is to buy clothes in the six to 12 months range—since everyone will give them newborn clothes (it’s tough to resist, I know, they’re absolutely adorable), it’ll be a relief for the parents a few months down the line to find that suddenly-chubby little one still has something in the closet that fits. Whatever you choose, you’re certain to find some good ideas on our expert-curated list of the best baby gifts for newborns.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-gifts-for-newborns>Our top picks for the best gifts for newborns</h2><h3>Best baby bibs gift for newborns: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Bumkins Baby Bibs, SuperBib 3-Pack, Baby & Toddler Ages 6-24 Mos (Rainbows & Unicorns)</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Bumkins Baby Bibs, SuperBib 3-Pack, Baby & Toddler Ages 6-24 Mos (Rainbows & Unicorns)</h3></p><p>You truly won’t believe how many <a rel=alternate href=#>baby bibs</a> a little one goes through once they start on solids, so honestly, this is one of those can’t-go-wrong gifts you’ll never have too many of. “Bumkins presents an assortment of vibrant and waterproof bibs that infuse mealtime with a touch of flair,” says Jeff Mills, director at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Baby & Co</a>. “These adaptable bibs are available in various sizes, catering to both infants and toddlers.

For that reason, it’s vital to get one you like. “Diaper and nappy bags have undergone a fashionable transformation, emerging as essential accessories for modern parents,” says Mills. “Our endorsement goes to PacaPod changing bags, as they seamlessly blend style with practicality.

For those wanting to save a little time with the swaddling process, velcro swaddles are a good way to go. “Velcro swaddles take the guesswork out of swaddling,” says Huff. “This is one gift I personally give all parents.” She recommends aden + anais’ swaddles, which feature a handy zip at the bottom, allowing you to change the baby’s diaper without completely unswaddling them.

Even once they’d graduated to solids, it was a handy place to dry off all their bowls, spoons, and everything else that had inevitably gone on the floor in a Pollock-esque swirl of pureed fruits and veggies.</p><p>Price on publish: $24.99</p><h4 class=title>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Cute</li><li>Convenient</li></ul><h4 class=title>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The tree-like drying racks don’t lock into place and can sometimes fall down</li></ul><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-baby-gifts-for-newborns>What to consider when choosing baby gifts for newborns</h2><p>“The arrival of a newborn is a special moment, and choosing the right gift can truly enhance the experience,” says Mills. “Whether you're searching for a unique present for your own baby or looking to delight friends and family, there's an array of options that demonstrate love and thoughtfulness.”</p><p>With that in mind, here are a few factors you should consider.</p><h3>Practicality</h3><p>“Parents really don't need a lot of fancy clothes, shoes, or devices, especially if they haven't asked for them!” says Huff. “Baby sunglasses are cute and fur vests are great for dressing up, but practical and helpful gifts for new parents are what people should consider when shopping. I like to purchase one item from the registry and give one item I found useful as a mom, or that I know will be used all the time.”</p><p>Huff goes on to advise to think about what would make those days easier on the parents. Are they bottle feeding? A bottle drying rack and cleaning brush might be a great gift that has been overlooked. Will they be diapering? A diaper caddy that transfers from room to room is super helpful and keeps parents organized.</p><h3>Longevity</h3><p>“In the world of newborn gifting, certain gifts have stood the test of time,” says Mills. “Cuddly soft toys, soothing teethers, and comforting blankets are enduring favorites that bring joy year-round. Amidst the ever-evolving landscape of baby gifts, the simple charm of a plush friend remains unmatched.”</p><h3>Thoughtfulness</h3><p>“A thoughtful approach worth considering is selecting a personalized gift, uniquely customized to suit a range of occasions, from the joyous occasion of a birth to the solemnity of christenings,” suggests Mills. “This choice imbues your present with a personal touch, creating a lasting impression that resonates deeply with the recipient. Here's a valuable tip: Begin by considering both the baby's age and the specific occasion. For instance, if the gift is intended for a baby shower, practical choices like baby blankets might be perfect. These items are consistently well-received and incredibly handy during the initial months of parenthood.”</p><h3>Size</h3><p>“When buying gifts, consider the type of space and location new parents will be in,” advises Huff. “For instance, a full size swing will take up too much space in a smaller apartment and the baby might not even like the swing. A smaller compact or portable swing that folds away would suit the space better.”</p><h3>Price</h3><p>“Remember, your gift doesn't need to be extravagant,” says Mills. “There are numerous budget-friendly items that convey your care effectively. For instance, charming activity books designed to engage and nurture young minds through tactile experiences and vibrant colors. By embracing these insights, you can confidently choose a gift that resonates deeply without stretching your budget. Should you find yourself struggling for ideas, a gift voucher from a local baby store is a thoughtful gesture that covers a range of baby essentials, warmly appreciated by any parent.”</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-baby-gifts-for-newborns>How we selected the best baby gifts for newborns</h2><p>All of our selections were made through a combination of advice from baby industry experts along with a deep dive into the world of infant products.
