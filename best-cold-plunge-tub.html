Let’s take a closer look at how you select one that’s appropriate for you.</p><h3>Size</h3><p>You can find cold plunges in a variety of shapes and sizes, including those where you sit with your knees tucked closer into your body or larger so you can stretch your legs out. Determining the appropriate size depends on your preferred plunge position and how much space you have indoors or outdoors to hold the tub.</p><h3>Capacity</h3><p>Capacity is one of the most important factors, because if you’re tall, it’s possible you might not fit (at least comfortably) in a cold plunge tub and get the full benefit of your body immersed up to your neck. Most cold plunge products will tell you what size it works best for, such as up to six feet, six inches for example. Others may offer two different capacities for the same product, with a larger option accommodating taller individuals.</p><h3>Temperature range</h3><p>Temperature range is another major factor, with some plunges getting as low as 36 or 39 degrees Fahrenheit, while other models may not go below 50 degrees. You may also consider a cold plunge that offers hot therapy as well, so you can get an additional therapeutic benefit from the tub. Keep in mind there’s <a rel=nofollow href=#>no exact temperature</a> you must use, since temperatures below 60 degrees Fahrenheit are shown to offer benefits—plus you can start higher and gradually decrease the temperature.</p><h3>Indoor/outdoor</h3><p>Another consideration is whether your unit can go indoors, outdoors, or both. No matter where you place your unit, bear in mind the tubs get super heavy once filled with water—up to several hundred pounds. So be sure your preferred spot can handle the load.</p><h3>Insulation</h3><p>Look for insulated models, unless you don’t mind it taking several hours for your cold plunge to get to your desired temperature. If you want a better-performing insulated material where you can quickly get to the optimum temperature, look for stainless steel or acrylic materials and double-wall insulation.</p><h3>Chiller versus adding ice</h3><p>You can purchase models with an external chiller, which automatically regulates the temperature of the water for you and quickly gets you to the precise, preferred temperature. However, this convenience comes with added cost, but you can find more budget-friendly options that don’t include an external chiller. Instead they rely on you adding ice for reaching optimal temperatures.</p><h2 id=how-did-we-select-the-best-cold-plunge-tubs>How did we select the best cold plunge tubs?</h2><p>I selected the best cold plunge tubs by incorporating insights from Dr. Walker. I also reviewed dozens of models, analyzed the features, read through customer reviews, plus I considered various price points to determine my list of the top picks.</p><h2 id=benefits-of-cold-plunge-tubs>Benefits of cold plunge tubs</h2><p>Cold plunges can have numerous benefits. “The clinical benefits are well established: to boost mental and physical performance while mood, focus, and attention all increase,” explains Dr. Walker. "The mental resilience you gain from the training is second to none,” Dr. Walker adds. He goes on to say, “There are physiological benefits too, including an increase in adrenaline and dopamine which have profound impacts, especially first thing in the morning to start the day.”</p><p>A review of clinical studies, published online in September 2022 in the <a rel=nofollow href=#>International Journal of Circumpolar Health</a>, supports the claims of cold plunges having some health benefits, possibly including the reduction of inflammation, a boosted immune response, and more, but the full breadth of benefits may not yet be realized.</p><h2 id=self-chilling-versus-diy-cold-plunge>Self-chilling versus DIY cold plunge</h2><p>Self-chilling, which means using a cold plunge tub, versus a DIY model, like filling up your own bathtub with ice or using a sealed ice chest, may offer greater convenience. Cold plunge tubs are more expensive than DIY chilling methods. However, if you find yourself regularly cold plunging or live in a warmer climate where it’s hard to maintain a colder water temperature, then it may be worth the investment to you to get a cold plunge tub. You can also benefit from having an exact temperature control with a cold-plunge tub.</p><p>If you’re new to cold plunging or aren’t sure you’re ready for an investment, start out with a DIY option and see what benefits it offers you.</p><h2 id=ideal-temperatures-guides-for-beginners>Ideal temperatures guides for beginners</h2><p>Beginners will want to start at a temperature where they feel uncomfortable, but it’s still doable, advises RenuTherapy. You can even start with 30 days of cold showers first, before moving on to the cold plunge. You can start with 60-second cold immersions and eventually work your way up to no more than 10 minutes at a time. As you get acclimated to the temperature, you can gradually decrease it. Most <a rel=nofollow href=#>manufacturers recommend</a> staying within the ideal temperature range of 40 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How big of a tub do I need for a cold plunge?</h3><p>The size of the tub depends on your height and whether you prefer to sit with your knees closer to your chest or if you prefer to stretch your legs. Once you know which you prefer, then you can search for a cold plunge model that accommodates your height and seating preference.</p><h3>Can you do a cold plunge in a bathtub?</h3><p>Yes, you can submerge yourself into cold water in your bathtub, however it might not offer some of the convenient benefits of other cold-plunge tubs. For example, the water may not get down to your desired temperature, so you may need to add ice to cool it down further.</p><h3>How long should you cold plunge?</h3><p>Beginners will start out spending less time in a cold plunge and then work up to longer sessions. Eventually, you can aim for about 11 minutes a week, which can be broken down into two or three sessions, according to Dr. Walker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk6S5pXnPpaynn5Viwbaujg%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./daniel-bruhl-next-door-berlin-film-festival-berlinale-1234919234.html>&#171;&nbsp;Daniel Bruhl on Using Words as Weapons in Directorial Debut Black Comedy Next Door</a>
