However, what she uncovered later made her wish he&nbsp;had cheated instead.</p><p><h2>The woman stumbled upon a&nbsp;tampon in&nbsp;her husband’s car that clearly wasn’t hers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f65/f4d/d0fd5a5473a143e2a54a57382b.jpg><p>«I&nbsp;have <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>been</a> with my&nbsp;husband for seven years, married for four. I’ve never had reason to&nbsp;suspect he&nbsp;was unfaithful to&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;wouldn‘t have questioned that, or&nbsp;him, were it&nbsp;not for a&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;I found in&nbsp;his car last month. When buckling our daughter into her car seat, I&nbsp;noticed something slotted between the cushions. I&nbsp;pulled it&nbsp;out and saw that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;tampon.</p><p>This wouldn’t have been so&nbsp;unusual had&nbsp;I not had an&nbsp;IUD that has stopped my&nbsp;period for the past year, and&nbsp;I didn’t even recognize the wrapper style. I&nbsp;brought it&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s attention, and he&nbsp;didn’t seem to&nbsp;understand what it&nbsp;was. He&nbsp;shrugged and said it&nbsp;probably belonged to&nbsp;his coworker, Fiona. It’s not uncommon for my&nbsp;husband to&nbsp;carpool to&nbsp;lunch with his coworkers, and we’re both fairly close to&nbsp;Fiona and her husband, so&nbsp;I figured the tampon might have slipped out of&nbsp;her purse whenever he&nbsp;had driven with them.»</p><p><h2>She couldn’t shake off her doubts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b4c/7fd/c8c02a52029ce9c52fb7f15931.png><p>«I&nbsp;put it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mind until we&nbsp;had dinner with Fiona and her husband a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;weeks later. I&nbsp;faked an&nbsp;„emergency“ and asked Fiona if&nbsp;she had any tampons while we&nbsp;were out together. She handed me&nbsp;one almost identical to&nbsp;the tampon I’d found in&nbsp;our backseat, and&nbsp;I breathed a&nbsp;sigh of&nbsp;relief. So&nbsp;the tampon there was probably the same, and in&nbsp;all likelihood, there was an&nbsp;innocent explanation as&nbsp;to&nbsp;why it&nbsp;had been left in&nbsp;the backseat in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p>I&nbsp;thought I’d seen the last of&nbsp;the out-of-place feminine hygiene products until&nbsp;I found another tampon this morning. This time in&nbsp;my&nbsp;sock drawer. I&nbsp;feel physically ill at&nbsp;the thought of&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband having an&nbsp;affair and even more nauseated at&nbsp;the thought that the woman might have left these tampons out for me&nbsp;to&nbsp;find.»</p><p><h2>Upon discovering a&nbsp;second tampon, another troubling piece of&nbsp;evidence emerged, further suggesting that something was wrong.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f8/ebc/380b6b5893b76dbf7e0f926526.jpg><p>«Shortly after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posting</a> on&nbsp;here, I&nbsp;told my&nbsp;sister what happened. We&nbsp;compared tampons and they were a&nbsp;match, just with different absorbencies. My&nbsp;sister was convinced it&nbsp;was Fiona—either having an&nbsp;affair with my&nbsp;husband, lying to&nbsp;me, or&nbsp;both.</p><p>My&nbsp;sister and&nbsp;I agreed that it&nbsp;was too soon for cameras without any other evidence, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;waiting game from there. It&nbsp;wasn’t until my&nbsp;younger daughter (2&nbsp;y/o) came down with something last week that&nbsp;I felt any differently. I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the one home taking care of&nbsp;her, but my&nbsp;husband insisted that&nbsp;I stay at&nbsp;work while he&nbsp;stayed home with her. Toward the end of&nbsp;that week, though, I&nbsp;came home to&nbsp;something strange.</p><p>The toddler that I’d left that morning in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old&nbsp;PJ set was now dressed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;onesie I’d never seen before, with a&nbsp;tiny clip in&nbsp;her hair. I&nbsp;can’t say&nbsp;I have the sharpest memory, but&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;pretty good sense of&nbsp;what my&nbsp;kids wear on&nbsp;a&nbsp;day-to-day basis, and particularly what kinds of&nbsp;clothes they wear. I&nbsp;didn’t think twice, and&nbsp;I went straight to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband to&nbsp;ask if&nbsp;anyone had been over to&nbsp;see him or&nbsp;the girls. He&nbsp;denied it&nbsp;and told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;calm down.</p><p>Our older daughter was in&nbsp;the room, and she sensed something was&nbsp;up. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;calmer voice, I&nbsp;asked him a&nbsp;third time if&nbsp;anyone had been around our children, and my&nbsp;husband swore that the girls hadn’t been around anyone but him. He&nbsp;also denied buying new clothes or&nbsp;doing anyone’s hair. With our daughter in&nbsp;the room and my&nbsp;emotions all over the place, I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;leave&nbsp;it.»</p><p><h2>The truth came to&nbsp;light unexpectedly, leaving the woman in&nbsp;profound shock.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e82/981/c0f9a354d0b573430e850c8b54.png><p>The woman’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>update</a> to&nbsp;her story revealed a&nbsp;truth that instantly turned her life upside down.</p><p>«A&nbsp;Ring notification had alerted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;motion at&nbsp;the front door while&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;work. Half-expecting to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;delivery person, pet, or&nbsp;lawncare salesman for the fifteenth time, you can imagine my&nbsp;surprise when&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;clip of&nbsp;a&nbsp;young woman leading my&nbsp;daughter into the house hand-in-hand, with my&nbsp;husband and other daughter close behind them.</p><p>The girls were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;daycare and my&nbsp;husband was at&nbsp;work. The woman, as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;I&nbsp;knew, was living two states away with a&nbsp;court order keeping her there. The woman on&nbsp;the camera was my&nbsp;husband’s sister. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;would come to&nbsp;find out later, she was the likely source of&nbsp;both tampons, the onesie, and the bow.</p><p>But the most disturbing thing of&nbsp;all was that this person had severe problems with the law, and she was strongly prohibited from even approaching the kids. «I&nbsp;hadn’t seen or&nbsp;heard from her in&nbsp;years, and from the way my&nbsp;husband talked about her, I&nbsp;didn’t expect&nbsp;I ever would. But here she was, in&nbsp;our house, with our children.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b7c/2c1/d8fa385a98957a4e23f54c3ec7.png><p>«It&nbsp;wasn’t an&nbsp;affair at&nbsp;all and still, somehow, infinitely more disgusting knowing who it&nbsp;was and <i>why</i> all of&nbsp;this had been happening. Apparently, my&nbsp;SIL, fresh off another stint in&nbsp;rehab, had wanted to&nbsp;reconnect and make amends with people she’d hurt, and my&nbsp;husband was high on&nbsp;that list. My&nbsp;husband didn’t want me&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;or, worse, try and keep „her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>“ (our children) away from her, so&nbsp;they’d been meeting in&nbsp;secret—often at&nbsp;our house when&nbsp;I was at&nbsp;work.</p><p>They would enter through the garage, in&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband’s car, so&nbsp;the Ring camera at&nbsp;the front door wouldn’t tip me&nbsp;off. She spent the night on&nbsp;a&nbsp;weekend&nbsp;I had been on&nbsp;a&nbsp;business trip and slept in&nbsp;our bed. She babysat our girls on&nbsp;a&nbsp;night my&nbsp;husband told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;had dropped them off at&nbsp;his parents. She bought the girls’ clothes and dressed my&nbsp;youngest in&nbsp;the onesie and bow that my&nbsp;husband had promised in&nbsp;his life&nbsp;I had dressed her in&nbsp;myself.</p><p>My&nbsp;husband swore this was all in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head. He&nbsp;was perfectly content to&nbsp;watch me&nbsp;agonize for weeks over a&nbsp;woman he&nbsp;insisted didn’t exist. He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;I wasn’t sleeping enough, that&nbsp;I missed the girls too much, and that&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;step back and reevaluate the state of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mental health. I&nbsp;gave him the benefit of&nbsp;the doubt because he&nbsp;was my&nbsp;husband, and because no&nbsp;other version of&nbsp;events made sense. Now, after a&nbsp;month of&nbsp;this, I&nbsp;have nothing to&nbsp;show for my&nbsp;trust but this pathetic situation. And a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;anger.»</p><p>Trust is&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;build, easy to&nbsp;break, and tough to&nbsp;fix.
