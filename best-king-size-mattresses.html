There are so many options out there that trying to find the right one can be a royal pain in the neck, so we’ve whittled them down and crowned the following nine the best king-size mattresses in their respective categories. Long live the king!</p><p>Royally bad puns aside, there are several important considerations to take into account when shopping for a king size mattress. We’ll get into them in more detail below, but in brief, you’ll want to think about the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Who the bed is for:</strong> Do you actually need as much space as a king size mattress offers?</li><li><strong>Firmness level:</strong> Some mattresses on our list are available in various firmness levels, but others are not, so make sure you have an idea of what you’re looking for.</li><li><strong>Bedroom size:</strong> A bedroom should ideally be a minimum of 10 by 12 feet for a king size bed to fit properly.</li><li><strong>Body size:</strong> While king size mattresses are generally great for larger bodies, heavier folks might want to check out something specially designed for their needs.</li><li><strong>Sleeping position:</strong> Side sleepers, back sleepers, and stomach sleepers all have slightly different needs in terms of softness and support.</li><li><strong>Temperature preference:</strong> If you run hot, consider a mattress with cooling features.</li><li><strong>Motion isolation:</strong> If you’re sharing a bed with someone else, this is an important aspect to consider, since a bed with good motion isolation means you won’t feel it every time your partner rolls over.</li><li><strong>Pricing:</strong> King size mattresses inevitably get expensive, so check you’re not paying for features you don’t need.</li><li><strong>Returns, trial period, and warranty:</strong> Check that the brand you’re buying from makes returns easy, and offers solid trial periods and warranties so you feel confident in your purchase.</li></ul><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-a-king-size-mattress>What to consider when buying a king-size mattress</h2><p>To determine if a king size mattress is right for you, consider the following:</p><h3>Who’s sleeping in the bed</h3><p>“A king-size bed offers ample space for couples, providing approximately 38 inches of personal space for each sleeper,” says Byron Golub, vice president of product and merchandising at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Saatva</a>. “It’s a really good option if one partner tends to be a restless or active sleeper, as it allows you to move around comfortably without disturbing your partner.”</p><h3>Desired comfort level/firmness</h3><p>“As king-size mattresses are typically shared by two individuals, it's important to take both of your comfort preferences into account when searching for a suitable option,” says Golub. “If finding a consensus on firmness level proves challenging, a medium-firm mattress can be an ideal compromise. Alternatively, you might consider a split king mattress, allowing each of you to select your preferred mattress firmness. Generally speaking, softer mattresses are well-suited for side sleepers, while those who favor sleeping on their backs tend to find medium-firm mattresses more comfortable. Stomach sleepers typically benefit from a firmer mattress for optimal support and comfort.”</p><h3>Bedroom size</h3><p>“A king-size bed is an excellent option for primary bedrooms—ideally, you’ll want your bedroom to be on the larger side,” advises Golub. “At a minimum, a bedroom should be 10 by 12 feet for a king-size bed; however, the larger, the better is a good rule when it comes to king-size beds. Preferably, your bedroom will measure somewhere around 14 by 19 feet. If maneuvering in the space is an issue, it might be best to consider a split king or queen-size mattress, which are easier to fit up narrow stairs and through tight doorways.”</p><h3>Body size</h3><p>“King mattresses provide plenty of space for heavier individuals and bigger couples,” says Golub. “Additionally, taller individuals may want to consider choosing a Texas, Alaskan, or Wyoming king-size mattress. The extra legroom can add an extra level of comfort for tall people.”</p><h3>Sleeping position</h3><p>Sleeping position is also hugely important, as sleeping on your side, for example, means you’ll have different requirements to those who sleep on their backs, or stomachs. All sleepers require some balance of lumbar support and pressure-point relief, but it’s always worth checking which sleeping position the mattress you’re looking at is best suited for.</p><h3>Temperature preferences</h3><p>Per Golub, if you sleep hot, it might be best to avoid memory foam mattresses, as they have a tendency to retain heat. Innerspring and latex mattresses offer a cooler sleeping experience.</p><h3>Motion isolation</h3><p>“When it comes to minimizing motion disturbance, memory foam mattresses are great options,” says Golub. “Conversely, you may experience disruptions from your partner's movements if you share an innerspring mattress, which can affect your sleep quality. If you prefer the traditional feel of an innerspring mattress but share your bed with a partner, it's worth exploring hybrid mattresses, as they offer a compromise by mitigating motion transfer.”</p><h3>Pricing</h3><p>While there are some good cheap mattresses out there, generally speaking, a truly comfortable, supportive, and long-lasting mattress is going to cost more. Do be mindful, though, of paying for features you don’t need, for example, extra cooling features if you don’t run especially hot at night.</p><h3>Trials, returns, and warranties</h3><p>Since it’s tough to know for sure if a new mattress is going to work out, always opt for a brand that gives you options. Ideally, you want one that offers both free deliveries and returns, as well as a decent trial period (100+ days, if possible) during which you can return the mattress at any time if you feel it’s not working out. Look at the warranty period too–mattresses should last from eight to ten years, so if the warranty period covers at least this much, it might save you some grief if things go wrong.</p><h2 id=our-top-king-size-mattress-picks>Our top king-size mattress picks</h2><h3>Best hybrid king mattress: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Helix Midnight Luxe</a></h3><p>Hybrid mattresses combine the best of both worlds, mixing the comfort and give of foams with the support and stability of innerspring mattresses. The Helix Midnight Luxe finds the sweet spot exactly, with four different layers of foam sandwiching a supportive layer of around 1,000 individually wrapped coils. This all adds up to a mattress with great motion isolation, spinal alignment, pressure point relief, and edge support.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Mattress type: Hybrid</li><li>Thickness: 13.5 inches</li><li>Trial period: 100 days</li><li>Warranty: 15 years</li><li>Price on publish: $2,299</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we like:</h3><ul><li>Only takes 30-45 minutes to fully expand</li><li>Minimal motion transfer</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we don't Like:</h3><ul><li>Some customer reviews complain that it’s a little too soft</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>With great motion isolation, lumbar support, and pressure-point relief, this is our pick for the best hybrid king mattress.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best hybrid king mattress</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Helix Midnight Luxe</h3></p><h3>Best king memory foam mattress: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress</a></h3><p>If you’re feeling less “head of state” and more, “my bed’s a state,” it’s time to upgrade to a better mattress. Our pick for the best memory foam option is Leesa’s Original hybrid, which, admittedly, isn’t an all-memory foam model, but bear with us. Its multiple layers of foam–that sandwich the supportive coils at its center–combine to make a mattress that has such a great balance of contouring and pressure relief that it will work for virtually any position, although it’s particularly great for side sleepers (who make up the majority of the population). “Combining memory foam with pocket springs, Leesa’s Original Hybrid mattress provides the cushioning side sleepers need for their shoulders and hips, while maintaining spinal alignment,” says Smith.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Mattress type: Hybrid</li><li>Thickness: 11 inches</li><li>Trial period: 100 days</li><li>Warranty: Ten years</li><li>Price on publish: $1,349</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we like:</h3><ul><li>Low motion transfer</li><li>Supportive</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we don't Like:</h3><ul><li>Might be too soft for sleepers who switch between side and stomach sleeping</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A hybrid mattress that combines memory foams with coils for a supportive and comfortable night’s rest.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best king memory foam mattress</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Leesa Original Hybrid Mattress, Queen</h3></p><h3>Best cooling king size mattress: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe</a></h3><p>If your cooling sheets aren’t cutting it, you could try choosing a mattress designed to bring down the heat a little, like Brooklyn Bedding’s Aurora Luxe. Below the GlacioTex cover (which actively draws heat away from your snoozing body), it has multiple layers of foam, including one infused with thermoregulating phase change material and another with cooling gel. The layer of springs also helps to promote air flow within the mattress, keeping you cooler than all-foam models.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Mattress type: Hybrid</li><li>Thickness: 13.25 inches</li><li>Trial period: 120 days</li><li>Warranty: Ten years</li><li>Price range on publish: $1,998.80</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we like:</h3><ul><li>Cooling</li><li>Available in three firmness options (soft, medium and firm)</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we don't Like:</h3><ul><li>Might be too soft for heavier sleepers</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A supportive yet comfy mattress with built-in cooling technology.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best cooling king size mattress</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Brooklyn Bedding Aurora Luxe</h3></p><h3>Best king size mattress for side sleepers: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nolah Evolution</a></h3><p>Despite being far and away the most popular sleeping position, spending the night on your side isn’t actually that great for your body, aggravating pressure points like the hips and shoulders and causing your spine to be improperly aligned. Ideally, you need a mattress that cradles and supports in the right places, which Nolah’s Evolution does through its clever layering of gently cushioning foams and stabilizing, lumbar supporting coils. It’s also available in three different firmness options, so you can find the ideal amount of give for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Mattress type: Hybrid</li><li>Thickness: 15 inches</li><li>Trial period: 120 days</li><li>Warranty: Lifetime</li><li>Price on publish: $1,754</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we like:</h3><ul><li>Three firmness options (plush, luxury firm, firm)</li><li>Supportive but soft</li><li>Greenguard Gold and CertiPUR-US certified</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we don't Like:</h3><ul><li>Might be too soft for stomach sleepers</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A mattress carefully constructed to offer plenty of support for side-sleepers while still being extremely comfortable.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best king size mattress for side sleepers</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Nolah Evolution 15"</h3></p><h3>Best king size mattress for back pain: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Bear Elite Hybrid</a></h3><p>If back pain turns every night into a battle royal between you and your bed, consider choosing a mattress designed to support your spine properly. In terms of the best mattresses for back pain, we recommended Bear’s Elite hybrid. The top two layers of foam cushion pressure points, keeping you comfortable, while the coils underneath offer balanced spinal support, motion isolation, and edge support. As a bonus, it comes with a free sleep accessories set worth $400, which includes two pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Mattress type: Hybrid</li><li>Thickness: 14 inches</li><li>Trial period: 120 nights</li><li>Warranty: Lifetime</li><li>Price on publish: $1,796</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we like:</h3><ul><li>Comes with free sleep accessories set</li><li>Super supportive but with give where needed</li><li>Copper-infused memory foam layer is both cooling and antimicrobial</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we don't Like:</h3><ul><li>A small number of customers found it was a little too soft for their needs</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A supportive, comfortable mattress designed to help people with back pain get a better night’s sleep, every night.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best king size mattress for back pain</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Bear Elite Hybrid</h3></p><h3>Best affordable king-size mattress: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Zinus Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress</a></h3><p>If you want to buy a king-size mattress but don’t have access to the royal treasury, you’ll need to look for a more wallet-friendly option (which also made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best mattresses in a box</a>). Brad Smith, interior designer and CEO at Omni Home Ideas, suggests trying out Zinus’ Green Tea memory foam mattress, saying, “This mattress offers a balanced combination of comfort and support, infused with green tea for freshness, and is priced reasonably for its quality.” Waking up to the smell of fresh green tea every day? You must be royalty after all.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Mattress type: Memory foam</li><li>Thickness: 6, 8, 10, or 12 inches</li><li>Trial period: 100 days</li><li>Warranty: Ten years</li><li>Price on publish: $279-$539</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we like:</h3><ul><li>Soft</li><li>Inexpensive</li><li>Contains ActivCharcoal microparticles to help block moisture and odor</li><li>Made from three different layers of foam to strike the right balance of comfort and support</li></ul><h3 class=title>What we don’t like:</h3><ul><li>A handful of customer reviews complain that the mattress didn’t fully decompress when unpackaged</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>An affordable king-size mattress that comes with the added bonus of multiple thickness options and a fresh, relaxing scent.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable king-size mattress</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Zinus Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress</h3></p><h3>Most comfortable king-size mattress: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Purple RestorePremier Hybrid Mattress</a></h3><p>Fit for a king is one thing, but some of us need a mattress fit for a princess—ideally without the pea underneath. For a super comfortable option, Smith recommends Purple’s RestorePremier Hybrid. “With its unique hyper-elastic polymer grid and combination of coils, it's known for offering both support and pressure relief, adapting to the body's shape and sleeping position,” he says.

We also took pains to ensure all of our entries had glowing customer reviews, especially in terms of comfort, durability, and supportiveness.</p><h2 id=different-types-of-king-size-mattresses>Different types of king-size mattresses</h2><p>“There are several different types of king-size mattresses on the market,” says John Merwin, CEO of <a rel=nofollow href=#>3Z Brands</a>. “The most common are the standard king and California king, which are available with most mattress brands. There are also split kings, RV kings, and short kings, which are more niche variations of the king bed, designed to fit specific needs or spaces. Most people don’t know that there are actually sizes bigger than a king or California king, too—they’re not common among most bedding retailers, but Alaskan king, Wyoming king, and Texas king mattresses do exist.”</p><p>According to Golub, alternative king-size mattresses are sized as follows.</p><ul><li>California king (72 x 84 inches)</li><li>Wyoming king (84 x 84 inches)</li><li>Texas king (80 x 98 inches)</li><li>Alberta king (96 x 96 inches)</li><li>Alaskan king (108 x 108 inches)</li></ul><p>“There is also a split king mattress option, which, in the case of the standard king, is two twin XL mattresses (38 by 80 inches) put together to form a king mattress (76 by 80 inches),” adds Golub. “Since the beds aren't interconnected within a split king bed, partners can pick a different level of firmness for each mattress.”</p><h2 id=how-to-decide-between-a-king-versus-a-queen-mattress>How to decide between a king versus a queen mattress</h2><p>“A standard queen is a foot slimmer than the narrowest king mattress, the California king,” says Golub. “Queen mattresses are great for single sleepers and couples in smaller spaces. They work best in small to mid-sized primary bedrooms. King mattresses are great for couples wanting a little extra room, with a mid-sized to large primary bedroom that can accommodate a larger bed without it taking up too much space.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What size are king mattresses?</h3><p>“Standard king mattresses typically measure 76 inches wide by 80 inches long,” says Smith. “However, always check specific brand dimensions as there can be slight variations.”</p><p>Bonus fun fact: King-size mattresses are so titled in honor of England’s King Bernard VII, who, strangely, was the exact shape and dimensions of a king-size mattress, hence the name.*</p><p>* this might not be entirely true</p><p>For a more thorough look into the world of mattresses, check out our guide to <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress sizes and bed dimensions</a> and our ultimate buying guide to <a rel=alternate href=#>how to choose a mattress</a>.</p><h3>Are king-size beds good for couples?</h3><p>“A king-size bed provides more room for couples,” confirms Golub. “Each sleeper gets about 38 inches of space to themselves. It’s an excellent option if one of you is a restless or active sleeper, because you can comfortably move around without bothering your partner. They’re also great for families with kids and pets.”</p><h3>What should a good king-size mattress cost?</h3><p>“The cost of a good king-size mattress can vary widely, depending on factors such as materials, construction, and general features,” says Merwin. “On average, you can expect to pay between $700 and $3,000 for a king-size mattress.”</p><h3>Is a California king bigger than a king?</h3><p>“A California king mattress (72 inches by 84 inches) is four inches narrower and four inches longer than a standard king (76 inches by 80 inches),” says Golub. “You end up having slightly less surface area when you purchase a California king versus a standard king (6,048 square inches vs. 6,080 square inches), but what you lose in surface area may be worth it to provide certain sleepers with more comfort. The standard king is an excellent option for couples that want a little extra room and are placing the mattress in a mid-sized to large primary bedroom, while California kings are great for tall couples that need longer mattresses in a large primary bedroom.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lm567qHnSorGeZZ2WwbW%2BxKyqnqtf</p></div><div id=links><a href=./christian-estrosi-bruxelles-pour-faire-valider-le-zonage-pat.html>&#171;&nbsp;Christian Estrosi Bruxelles pour faire valider le zonage PAT</a>
