In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;holds the record for being the <a href=# title=heaviest data-link=tag>heaviest</a> human ever recorded! At&nbsp;his peak <a href=# title=weight data-link=tag>weight</a>, he&nbsp;weighed a&nbsp;whopping 1,400&nbsp;pounds!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ea3/82d/e6a76758638e5d6d686bc3e4e7.png><p>Now, let’s go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;his early life. When he&nbsp;was just 12&nbsp;years old, Jon already weighed 294&nbsp;pounds. By&nbsp;the time he&nbsp;turned&nbsp;22, he&nbsp;weighed 500&nbsp;pounds! As&nbsp;you can imagine by&nbsp;now, his weight continued to&nbsp;increase steadily over the years. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;36, he&nbsp;was hospitalized, because he&nbsp;had problems with his heart and difficulty breathing. On&nbsp;the bright side, that same year, he&nbsp;married his partner, Jeannette, and later became a&nbsp;proud father of&nbsp;two children. But Jon’s weight kept climbing, making his body retain a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;fluid.</p><p>Transportation was no&nbsp;easy feat for Jon, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;took over 12&nbsp;people and a&nbsp;custom stretcher to&nbsp;move him. When he&nbsp;was admitted to&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Washington Medical Center in&nbsp;Seattle, he&nbsp;was estimated to&nbsp;weigh over 1,400 pounds by&nbsp;the local doctor. It&nbsp;took more than 10&nbsp;individuals from the staff working together to&nbsp;simply roll him over for linen changes.</p><p>After spending over two years in&nbsp;the hospital, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;special low calorie diet, Jon was discharged weighing 476&nbsp;pounds. He&nbsp;had lost about 924&nbsp;pounds, which is&nbsp;the largest human weight loss ever documented at&nbsp;the time! However, he&nbsp;was admitted back to&nbsp;the hospital about a&nbsp;year later, as&nbsp;his weight had gone back&nbsp;up. Sadly, Jon passed away in&nbsp;1983, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bd7/247/4a692f5567a04d3b42cc827c60.png><p>Speaking of&nbsp;people with unusual measurements, ever heard about Robert Pershing Wadlow? People also called him the Alton Giant or&nbsp;the Giant of&nbsp;Illinois. This guy was seriously tall&nbsp;— we’re talking 8&nbsp;feet 11.1 inches tall! That’s even past the tallest NBA player in&nbsp;history, Gheorghe Muresan, who stretched to&nbsp;7&nbsp;feet 7&nbsp;inches.</p><p>Wadlow’s tall stature was due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;condition of&nbsp;his pituitary gland, which meant he&nbsp;had an&nbsp;abnormally high level of&nbsp;human growth hormone. Even at&nbsp;the time of&nbsp;his passing at&nbsp;age&nbsp;22, there was no&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;his growth slowing down. Imagine how hard it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;find clothes that fit and desks to&nbsp;sit at&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were that tall!</p><p>Despite his large size, Wadlow didn’t let it&nbsp;stop him from pursuing his dreams. He&nbsp;went to&nbsp;college looking to&nbsp;study law and even became a&nbsp;star after touring with the Ringling Brothers Circus and the International Shoe Company. But don’t get it&nbsp;twisted&nbsp;— he&nbsp;told people he&nbsp;was working in&nbsp;advertising, not exhibiting as&nbsp;a&nbsp;performer. Wadlow’s legacy lives on&nbsp;to&nbsp;this day. A&nbsp;life-size statue of&nbsp;him was erected in&nbsp;Alton, Illinois, and his story continues to&nbsp;fascinate people around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9f4/31a/195fd25b4197eeceac93187dca.png><p>A&nbsp;woman named Cathie Jung [Y-oong] set a&nbsp;similarly interesting record: the one for having the smallest waist on&nbsp;a&nbsp;person. Care to&nbsp;hear about her measurements? Her waist was said to&nbsp;be&nbsp;only 15&nbsp;inches! That means you could almost circle her waist with two dollar bills, can you believe&nbsp;it?</p><p>Cathie hasn’t achieved this by&nbsp;starving herself or&nbsp;anything like that. She’s been wearing corsets for the past 25&nbsp;years, only taking them off when she showers or&nbsp;when the weather is&nbsp;too hot to&nbsp;bear. Cathie is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real corset queen, owning over 100 handmade corsets. This woman has even appeared on&nbsp;TV shows in&nbsp;Japan, the&nbsp;US, and Western Europe. But don’t worry, her corsets don’t stop her from doing what she loves&nbsp;— fishing with her husband on&nbsp;their boat, “The Bobcat”. And she even has a&nbsp;special swimming costume with a&nbsp;corset sewn in&nbsp;so&nbsp;she can still go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the beach!</p><p>Well, well, well, it&nbsp;looks like this next story is&nbsp;about a&nbsp;real-life Sleeping Beauty! A&nbsp;little boy named Wyatt Shaw became quite the medical enigma when he&nbsp;fell into a&nbsp;deep slumber for not one, not two, but a&nbsp;whopping eleven days after serving as&nbsp;the ring bearer at&nbsp;his uncle’s wedding. Now, I’m no&nbsp;expert, but that sounds like the kind of&nbsp;nap&nbsp;I dream of&nbsp;taking after a&nbsp;long day at&nbsp;work. Unfortunately, for Wyatt and his family, it&nbsp;was far from a&nbsp;restful experience. His mom, Amy, struggled to&nbsp;wake him up&nbsp;the next day, and despite regaining consciousness briefly, Wyatt fell back into a&nbsp;deep sleep.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b18/0da/6e6e1051f5b18b5746514acabd.png><p>After visiting a&nbsp;doctor in&nbsp;his hometown of&nbsp;Elizabethtown, Kentucky, Wyatt was sent to&nbsp;Louisville for further testing. And let me&nbsp;tell you, those doctors did not mess around. They performed a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;procedures to&nbsp;try and figure out what was wrong with this unusual patient, including multiple MRIs. They tested for everything from viruses to&nbsp;bacteria, but all the results came back negative. Wyatt was free of&nbsp;any known viruses or&nbsp;infections that could cause such severe fatigue.</p><p>The doctors at&nbsp;the hospital even reached out to&nbsp;experts in&nbsp;Minnesota and London to&nbsp;try and get to&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;Wyatt’s mysterious sleep. Apparently, the doctor in&nbsp;London had seen a&nbsp;child sleep for ten days straight before, but Wyatt was determined to&nbsp;break that record and slept for eleven days. Talk about a&nbsp;competitive spirit! Finally, the doctors gave Wyatt a&nbsp;specific type of&nbsp;medication&nbsp;— generally used for seizures&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;woke&nbsp;up. It’s still unclear what caused his snooze fest, but doctors suspect that it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;a&nbsp;disruption in&nbsp;the parts of&nbsp;the brain responsible for regulating sleep patterns.</p><p>While Wyatt wasn’t diagnosed with Kleine-Levin [k-l-AY-n leh-VEEN] Syndrome, a&nbsp;disorder that causes a&nbsp;person to&nbsp;sleep for 12&nbsp;to&nbsp;24&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day, he&nbsp;showed similar symptoms to&nbsp;patients who have had the condition. When he&nbsp;finally woke&nbsp;up, he&nbsp;had difficulty swallowing and was unable to&nbsp;walk or&nbsp;speak because he&nbsp;had been asleep for so&nbsp;long. The good news is&nbsp;that Wyatt slowly began to&nbsp;improve after waking&nbsp;up. His speech and mobility got better, and doctors were hopeful that he&nbsp;would not experience prolonged sleep like that again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ad8/1ce/7f88105ad4afb74bcd0c613756.png><p>This next unusual record you’ll surely not want to&nbsp;break. Ever heard of&nbsp;Charles Osborne, the man who had hiccups for 68&nbsp;years? It&nbsp;all started when he&nbsp;fell down and hurt his head. This led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;small area of&nbsp;his brain being injured, which triggered the hiccup response. From then&nbsp;on, Osborne hiccupped non-stop, with an&nbsp;average of&nbsp;20-40 involuntary spasms per minute. He&nbsp;hiccupped an&nbsp;estimated 430 million times before his passing in&nbsp;1991&nbsp;at the age of&nbsp;97. That’s a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;hiccups!</p><p>Osborne tried to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;cure for his condition but couldn’t find a&nbsp;permanent one. One physician managed to&nbsp;stop the hiccups by&nbsp;placing him on&nbsp;carbon monoxide and oxygen, but sadly, Osborne couldn’t breathe in&nbsp;properly with this gas combination. Instead, he&nbsp;learned a&nbsp;breathing technique that minimized the “hic” sound, which is&nbsp;caused by&nbsp;the sudden closure of&nbsp;the vocal cords after an&nbsp;involuntary contraction. He&nbsp;breathed in&nbsp;between hiccups to&nbsp;suppress the noise. Imagine doing that for 68&nbsp;years! Despite his condition, Osborne was a&nbsp;fun-loving guy who enjoyed joking around with people. He&nbsp;didn’t even talk about his hiccupping much!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/89b/87c/ad4e2b5985b5d9f950aeac506a.png><p>One neurosurgeon had another theory on&nbsp;the cause of&nbsp;the hiccups. He&nbsp;believed that Osborne might have sustained a&nbsp;minor injury to&nbsp;the ribs during his 1922&nbsp;accident, which could have led to&nbsp;the endless hiccupping. Most hiccups are triggered by&nbsp;actions such as&nbsp;drinking too much soda, eating too much, getting excited, or&nbsp;swallowing air when chewing gum. They usually last just a&nbsp;few minutes and are more inconvenient than medically concerning. However, some hiccups continue for more than 48&nbsp;hours, at&nbsp;which point they’re considered chronic or&nbsp;persistent. In&nbsp;rare cases like Osborne’s, hiccups can last more than a&nbsp;month, becoming unmanageable.</p><p>But don’t worry, there are lots of&nbsp;remedies for hiccups. Take this folk cure for instance: drinking water through a&nbsp;paper towel! One explanation for this remedy is&nbsp;that we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;put in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit more effort to&nbsp;get the water out of&nbsp;the glass, similar to&nbsp;how a&nbsp;vacuum does its suction.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWmedaaqmasmJp6qbHAr6Ceq6Rivaa%2B0qilZp2mmr9uuMivnJ1laGaCcX6QaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./insertion-des-personnes-handicapees-la-commission-des-lois-du-senat-sinquiete-des-perspectives.html>&#171;&nbsp;la commission des lois du Snat s'inquite des perspectives budgtaires du FIPHFP</a>
